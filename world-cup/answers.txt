Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Initially, 10 simulations only output four teams.
Of those teams, three of them almost halved in probability when simulated 1000000 times

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

10000 simulations consistently yields the same order of results as 1000000 simulations.
Though the individual chances vary by small degrees, 100 milliseconds runtime is significantly shorter.
