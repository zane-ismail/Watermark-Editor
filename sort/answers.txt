sort1 uses: Bubble sort

Average run times on all three of the "sorted" text files was lowest.
Sort1 also had the overall lowest runtime for all the "sorted" text files.

Average run times on all "random" and "reversed" text files was lowest.
Sort 3 had the least range in 7 out of 9 runtimes, meaning it was the most consistent.
Because merge sort has a big O of n\sort
