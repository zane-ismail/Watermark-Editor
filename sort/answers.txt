sort1 uses: Bubble sort

sort2 uses: Merge sort

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:

Sort1 average run times on all three of the "sorted" text files was lowest.
Sort1 also had the overall lowest runtime for all the "sorted" text files.
Bubble sort has an upper bound of O(n2), so it did not perform optimally on the "random" and "reversed" text files.
However, it's lower bound is Ω(n), meaning if the data is in order, it can verify this in only one iteration.

Sort3 average run times are lowest for all text files, with only one exception.
Sort3 had the highest run times for the "sorted" text files.
Like bubble sort, selection sort has an upper bound of O(n2), which creates proportionately higher run times for more amounts of data.
If the data is already sorted, it still needs to iterate through an extra time to confirm this, so unlike bubble sort it has an lower bound of Ω(n2).

Sort2 run times on all "random" and "reversed" text files was lowest.
Sort2 had the least range in 7 out of 9 runtimes, meaning it was the most consistent.
Merge sort has an upper bound of O(n log n), so it is able to sort through large amounts of data more optimally than bubble and selection sort.
The organization and size of the data is less important, so the lowest and highest run times are more consistant with the average run times regardless of the text file.
