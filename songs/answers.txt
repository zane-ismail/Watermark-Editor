Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year. In answers.txt, reflect on the following questions:


If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer:


Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Answer:
Average energy = 0.65906, average valence = 0.484443, average danceability = 0.71646
High danceability, low valence
